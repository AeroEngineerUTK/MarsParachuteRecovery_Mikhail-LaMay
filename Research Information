Mars Pathfindes Mission Background
> Launched - 12.04.1996
> TouchDown - 06.04.1997
> Travel Time - 182 Days or 26 Weeks
> First-ever robotic rover to the surface of the red planet
> Pathfinder not only accomplished its' goal, but also returned an unprecedented amount of data and outlived its' primary design life.
> The Lander and 23-pound (10.6 kg) rover carried instruments for scientific observations and to provide engineering data on the new technologies being demonstrated.

> Martain Studies
    > Atmosphere
    > Climate
    > Geology
    > Rock/Soil Compostition
    
> Science Instruments
    > Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer
        > Determined the elemental composition of rocks and soils
    > Three Cameras
        > Provided images of the surrounding terrian for geological studies
        > Documented the performance and operating environment for Pathfinder mission technologies
    > Atmosphereic Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package
        > Measured the Martian atmosphere during Pathfinder's descent to the surface
        > Provided meteorological measurements at the lander
        
> Mars Pathfinder used an innovated method of directly entering the Martian atmosphere, assisted by a parachute to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere and a giant system of airbags to cushion the impact.

> Pathfinder's Airbag Landing
    > When landing on Mars, it relied on air bags much like those in automobiles to cuchion its landing.
    > This was tested at NASA Glenns' Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, OH.
        > This hosted tests of the innovative air bag landing gear system that enabled Pathfinder to bounc off the rugged terrain of Mars.
    > Typically, spacecraft use retrorockets firing intermittently towards the planet's surface to achieve soft landings
        > The Viking martian landers likewise used retrorockets
        > These are effective, but they are known to leave trace amounts of foriegn chemicals on the surface.
            > This was not used for the Pathfinder missions, because one of the objectives included analyzing the elemnetal composition of the Martian rocks and soil
            > This Airbag Landing system had to be developed to avoid contamination of samples.
