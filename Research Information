Mars Pathfindes Mission Background
> Launched - 12.04.1996
> TouchDown - 06.04.1997
> Travel Time - 182 Days or 26 Weeks
> First-ever robotic rover to the surface of the red planet
> Pathfinder not only accomplished its' goal, but also returned an unprecedented amount of data and outlived its' primary design life.
> The Lander and 23-pound (10.6 kg) rover carried instruments for scientific observations and to provide engineering data on the new technologies being demonstrated.

    > Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer
        > Determined the elemental composition of rocks and soils
    > Three Cameras
        > Provided images of the surrounding terrian for geological studies
        > Documented the performance and operating environment for Pathfinder mission technologies
    > Atmosphereic Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package
        > Measured the Martian atmosphere during Pathfinder's descent to the surface
        > Provided meteorological measurements at the lander
        
> Mars Pathfinder used an innovated method of directly entering the Martian atmosphere, assisted by a parachute to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere and a giant system of airbags to cushion the impact.

> Pathfinder's Airbag Landing
    > When landing on Mars, it relied on air bags much like those in automobiles to cuchion its landing.
    > This was tested at NASA Glenns' Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, OH.
        > This hosted tests of the innovative air bag landing gear system that enabled Pathfinder to bounc off the rugged terrain of Mars.
    > Typically, spacecraft use retrorockets firing intermittently towards the planet's surface to achieve soft landings
        > The Viking martian landers likewise used retrorockets
        > These are effective, but they are known to leave trace amounts of foriegn chemicals on the surface
            > This was not used for the Pathfinder missions, because one of the objectives included analyzing the elemnetal composition of the Martian rocks and soil
            > This Airbag Landing system had to be developed to avoid contamination of samples
    > The airbag system was composed of 24 interconnected spheres that protected the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft and its delicate payload composed of a lander, camera, and instrument-laden rover upon impact with the Martian surface.
        > This measured 17 ft tall and 17 ft in diameter, and was fabricated of materials similar to those used in space suits
        
> Pathfinder's Parachute Background
    > What??
        > The parachute helps slow the spacecraft down during entry, descent, and landing.
        > It is located in the backshell (green canister in the model to the left) - see parachute link above for figure
    > Theory??
        > The design of the parachute is drive by "loads" (the forces the parachute experienced as it full inflates).
        > Loads are calculated by using atmosphereric density, velocity, parachute drag area, and mass.
        > The parachute for our model mission is 40% larger than Pathfinder's because the largest load for the Mars Exploration Rover is between 18,000-19,000 lbs (80,100-84,600 N) when the parachute fully inflates.
            > By comparison, Pathfinder's inflation loads were approximatley 8,000 lbs (35,600 N)
            > N stands for "Newton," the unit of force required to accelerate a mass of 1 kg to 1 m/s
    > Construction??
        > Parachute is made out of two durable, lightweight fabrics: polyester and nylon
        > The parachute has a triple bridle (the tethers that connect connect the parachute to the backshell)
            > This bidle is made out of Kevlar, the same material used in bullet-proof vests
        > The material used to make the parachute must be strong, yet lightweight enough to fit inside a very small area and to prevent excess weight within the backshell.
        > The amount of space used to carry the parachute is so so small that the parachute must be pressure packed.
            > Before launch, a team must tighly fold together the 48 suspension lights, three bidle lines, and the parachute.
            > The parachute team loads the parachute in a special structure that then applies a heavy weight to the parachute package several times
            > Before placing the parachute into the backshell, the parachute is heated to sterlize it.
            
> Mars Pathfinder Atmospheric Entry: Trajectory Design and Dispersion Analysis
    > Enters Martian atmosphere directly from the interplanetary trajectory, with a veloicty of up to 7,350 m/s.      
    > Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) us designed to accommmodate the range of off-nominal entry trajectories due to navigation errors and uncertainties in atmospheric density, entry body and parachute drag profiles, parachute deplotment timing, and landing-site elevation.
    > The nominal entry conditions and attitude profile are given
    > Monte Carlo Simulations???
        > Terminal Descent - Three-DOF (translational)
        > Entry Phase, Prior to Parachute Deployment - Six-DOF (translational and rotational)
